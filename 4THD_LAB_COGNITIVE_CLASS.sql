-- Retrieve all employees whose address is in Elgin,IL.
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES 
WHERE ADDRESS LIKE '%Elgin,IL%';

-- Retrieve all employees who were born during the 1970â€™s.
-- Observation: i had troubles changing the datatype of B_DATE, so 
-- it's just varchar, thus i couldn't take the function YEAR
-- as i'm only working with 70's and 80's, its relatively easy to query manually
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE B_DATE LIKE '%197%';

--Retrieve all employees in department 5 whose salary is between 60000 and 70000.
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES 
WHERE DEP_ID = 5 
AND SALARY BETWEEN 60000 AND 70000;

-- Retrieve a list of employees ordered by department ID.
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES ORDER BY DEP_ID DESC;

--Retrieve a list of employees ordered in descending order by department ID 
-- and within each department ordered alphabetically in descending order by last name.
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES ORDER BY DEP_ID  DESC, L_NAME DESC;
