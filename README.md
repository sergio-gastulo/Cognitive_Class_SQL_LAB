# Cognitive_Class_SQL_LAB

These codes represent my knowledge of SQL Language. They are solutions to the problems proposed in the Cognitive Class course of SQL and Relational Databases 101. Of course, some problems might have been quite complicated and some hints were needed. I have given my best to solve carefully the problems and adding some extra comments in case clarifications are needed.   

Files needed to understand how the code works are uploaded as well.
